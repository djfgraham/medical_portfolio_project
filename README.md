# medical_portfolio_project
# This portfolio project was a culmination of the first handful of sections in the Data Analyst career path on Codecademy

# I feel that the difficulty was between easy and just right; I'm not sure if I didn't do enough analysis or didn't do complex enough work, but it did take between 6-8 hours to complete it all.

# This is my first project posting for review, so I have never had an outside party look at my code before. That being said, I am very interested in feedback as I know I have a lot to improve on and am only in the first few months of coding. Please don't hold any comments back as I want to know what I am doing right/wrong and I want to improve from these reviews!

# Thank you for tkaing the time to read this and review the project. Any comments will be helpful to me.
